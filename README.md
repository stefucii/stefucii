- 👋 Hi, I’m @stefucii, or at least some old friends call me this way ;) You can call me Stef [St'ef]
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, and my professional career is related with software development (see below)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (refreshing old knowledge over) MCUs and programming on a lower level than simply using available libraries.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now as I have little personal time to spend. However feel free to reach me about stuff regarding my hobby: model railroad automation
- 📫 How to reach me: Well, I am old fashioned, so you can reach me on skype (stoipetdesetkila)

My knowledge in programming languages include some, but mostly: C, JavaScript/TypeScript, as these are the most used ones by me over the last decade, switching between them.
Other used languages over the years: Asm (x86), C++, Pascal, PHP, Swift.
